## FAQ

### GotT?

["gift of the Time Lord" or "gift of the TARDIS"](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Translation_circuit) depending upon whether you're a Tom Baker or Christopher Eccleston fan respectively.

### What is a "voice modulator"?

A voice modulator is device for altering (or [modulating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation)) the sound of one's voice.

In the context of Daleks, this usually refers to [ring modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_modulation), whereby two signals mixed (i.e. - multiplied, or [Heterodyned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterodyne)). The first of these signals is typically a voice and the second is often a [sine wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave) at a frequency of about 30Hz.

This was originally accomplished through the use of a [Moog Ring Modulator similar to this](http://www.moogmusic.com/products/moogerfoogers/mf-102-ring-modulator).

While purists may argue that nothing sounds quite like a pair of audio transformers connected by a ring of four Germanium diodes (which is where the "ring" in "ring modulator" comes from), like the original Moog, GotT accomplishes this task in software.

GotT is a modern modulator for modern Daleks.
