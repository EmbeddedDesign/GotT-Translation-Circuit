## FAQ

### GotT?

["gift of the Time Lord" or "gift of the TARDIS"](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Translation_circuit) depending upon whether you're a Tom Baker or Christopher Eccleston fan respectively.

### What is a "voice modulator"?

A voice modulator is device for altering (or [modulating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation)) the sound of one's voice.

In the context of Daleks, this usually refers to [ring modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_modulation), whereby two signals are effectively mixed (i.e. - multiplied, or [Heterodyned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterodyne)). The first of these signals is typically a voice whereas the second is typcially a [sine wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave) (usually at a frequency of about 30Hz).

This was originally accomplished through the use of a [Moog Ring Modulator similar to this](http://www.moogmusic.com/products/moogerfoogers/mf-102-ring-modulator).

While purists may argue that nothing sounds quite like a pair of audio transformers connected by a ring (which is where the "ring" in "ring modulator" comes from) of four Germanium diodes, like the original Moog, GotT accomplishes this task in software.

GotT is a modern modulator for modern Daleks.

## Test Boards

Located in the /Electical/Test Boards/ folder of this repository are design files for a number of sub-circuit assemblies present on the GotT main board.

These were built primarily to test each sub-circuit in a standalone environment prior to incorporation in the larger GotT assembly.

They may also be useful by themselves or as parts of other projects.
